"""A mirrored name's owner has ONE storage location, in every module that mirrors one.

``sys.modules`` is where a module is stored. A module that mirrors a surface and
also holds a mapping to the resolved owner MODULE has a second storage location
for it, and the two can disagree: purging an owner and importing it again -- an
idiom this suite uses in twenty files -- leaves such a mapping reading and
forwarding writes to the discarded module while a direct importer holds the fresh
one. A test patching a control through the mirror then passes while exercising an
object nobody is running, and a later test in the same worker reads a value that
disagrees with its own owner, in another file, under some shard splits and not
others, with nothing pointing back at the cause.

The rule, stated once:

    a module that defines a module-level ``__getattr__``, or swaps its own
    ``__class__`` to forward attribute writes, MUST NOT hold a mapping whose
    values are module objects. It keeps the owner's dotted NAME and resolves it
    per use with ``importlib.import_module``, which answers from ``sys.modules``
    and waits on that module's import lock while its body runs.

These tests find the modules the rule binds BY THEIR SHAPE, read off the source
tree, rather than from a list of names. A module that begins mirroring a surface is
therefore covered on the commit that introduces it, with no edit here. A list would
be a second thing to remember, which is the same failure the rule is about.

Two guards keep that generation honest, because a case list derived from a detector
goes SILENT rather than red when the detector stops matching:
``test_the_shape_detector_answers_both_ways`` pins the detector on synthetic sources
it must accept and reject, and ``test_the_discovery_rule_answers_both_ways`` does the
same for the attribute discovery that the purge cases rest on.

The purge cases run in a child process. Importing a module binds it onto its parent
package, so a purge and reimport changes the ``sys.modules`` entry, the parent's
attribute, and any memo the mirror keeps; restoring one of the three in a ``finally``
leaves exactly the split-brain residue this rule forbids, and restoring all three is
a maintenance contract inside a test. A child process has no contract: its residue
leaves with it.
